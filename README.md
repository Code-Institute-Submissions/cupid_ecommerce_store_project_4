# 1. UX
 
### Project Goal
 
The main goal of my website is to help a potential user to find quickly, without having to browse numerous pages, a nice gift for his/her date. 
 
### Users Goals <br>
Each user visiting my site will be able to:
 
* Browse products within the store
* Filter the products by categories and price
* See all products displayed on one page.
* Search products by key words
* Add products to the cart
* Remove products from the cart
* Go through checkout process 
* To be able to place order with or without an account
* Sign up for an account
* Log into his profile page to check or/and modify personal information
* See order history
* Leave a comment under a product (This feature still needs to be fully developed)
 
### Site Owner's Goals:
 
* Provide users with a safe and secure e-commerce platform in order to generate revenue from sales.
* Build awareness for the brand and attract new buyers.
* Collect user session data for market research purposes.
* Be able to add, edit or remove orders
 
### Wireframes
 
Here are the images of the wireframes, which I sketched out in my notebook before starting coding. Planning my project on the paper allowed me to visualize the final product and made it easier to execute it.
<h2 align="center"><img src='/media/wireframes.JPG' style="margin: 0;"></h2>
 
### Design
 
* Colour Scheme<br>
The four main colours used in my site are light pink - for a site background, white - for some of the image's background to make them stand out and dark grey - for text and the footer. Red often associated with love and passion is a predominant color of the Cupid Store products.
<h2 align="center"><img src='/media/site_colors.png' style="margin: 0;"></h2>
 
* Typography<br>
For the development pupposes I used rather neutral, commonly used fonts that are easy to read, but in the further site development I am planning to change some of the  fonts into more handwriting style, which creates an ambiance of intimacy and give a more personal feeling to the site.
 
* Imagery<br>
The landing page is designed  to be striking and catch the user's attention with its warm and welcoming pink and stir curiosity and excitement with the red of two small hearts. A touch of glitter in the pink landing page background suggests luxury and promises an exciting shopping experience.
 
### User Stories<br>
* My friend Tom said "Cupid Store is a good idea for people who don't want to spend hours browsing through many different sites in search of a good first date gift. Everything is there, you just pick the one you like and it will be beautifully wrapped and delivered to your place. So it does save you a lot of time and energy that you would have to otherwise spend on looking for it.
* Cupid Store was also appealing to younger users. My friends' children would come and start browsing through the website for toys. They found bears and chocolates almost irresistible. Some of them brought their piggy bank money and wanted to be the first customers of Cupid Store.
* Kate, who likes to have everything done her way commented:' I wouldn't mind sending a link of Cupid Store to my boyfriend and  maybe even suggesting to him my gift preferences. That way I can get what I truly like and it also saves him a headache of wondering if I liked it or not.
 
# 2. Features
* Existing Features
Navbar<br>
The nav bar can be viewed on any of the pages of the website. From the nav bar, the user can navigate to the all-products page, sort products by price and categories. By clicking on the cart icon the user can go directly to the cart page and see the products he has added to the cart. From Profile icone, the user can access login, logout, registration forms and Profile page depending on whether he is logged in or not. Clicking on CUPID STORE logo will always take the user back to the all-products page.
 
Footer<br> Footer has the company owner name and a link to the github source code, but in the future it will be replaced with the company's contact details and a link to Customer service/or and Contact page.
 
 
All_Products page<br>
On the products page which can be accessed via the "Shop Now" button from the landing page or via CUPID STORE LOGO link in the nav bar, the user can view all cupid gifts for sale on the website. The user can sort them by price and categories. By clicking on a selected image the user can access the product detail page and get more information on the product he is interested in.
 
Detail Product page <br>
The Detail product page contains all the information of the selected product such as: product's name, price, description and a product review section (still under construction)
From the product page, the user can add items directly to their cart and navigate to the shopping cart page.
 
Shopping cart page<br>
Shopping cart page is the last step before the user navigates to the Checkout Page to purchase the selected products. Here the user can check his cart content and make a final shopping decision. The user can remove the products he doesn't want in his cart by clicking on the trash icon or, he can press the continue shopping button. If the user is satisfied with his shopping, he can press the checkout button.
 
Checkout page<br>
On the checkout page, the user can see the summary of his purchase and a payment form, which needs to be filled in in order to buy the products.
 
Thank you page.<br>
If the payment is successfully processed, the user is redirected to the Thank You for shopping page where he can see a detailed summary of his purchase.
 
If a user decides to log in, he can access his profile page with the order history.
 
* Features to implement
Review<br>
Finish working on the Customer Review section that has been partially developed and is sitting at the bottom of the Detail product page. I wrote a model and views for this feature, but it was was not working properly, so I removed Review related code and left only the form for the future development.
 
Contact Page<br>
Currently there is no contact section, but I would like to create  a page where customers can go and make enquiry about a product or service. The page should also include company's address and a Customer Service telephone number, 
 
Gift Wrapping section<br>
Gifts are given for special occasions for people we love and care about and every gift should be neatly packaged or come in a nice box. Part of my development plan for the site is to add wrapping service where customers could pick gift wrapping of their preference.
 
The Special Offers page is not developed yet. This section will have special offer and discount products

# 4. Testing
 
### Test performed during app development
 
1. Test whether allauth is working properly, I run the server with a command: 'python3 manage.py runserver'
I opened the project and navidated to accounts/login. I tried to login using superuser and this directed me to the page asking for email confirmation. This directed me back to a page telling me I needed to confirm my email. So allauth is working because email confirmations are required in order to log in.
 
2. At the beginning of creating home and about pages in my store app, I used HttpResponse to send some text to both pages to check if my setup is working.
 
3. I created a folder templates to contain all my html files, because django will look for templates by default
 
4. Creating home and about pages and testing them in a browser.
 
5. Testing responsiveness of desktop and mobile navbar in chrome dev tool by checking if all the features are nicely displayed on different screen sizes.
 
6. Tested json database with JSONLint https://jsonlint.com/ to check if it is properly written and matches category and product models.
 
7. Adding functionality to the search bar and testing it manually by inserting keywords from product description to see if the search query is working. 
 
8. Checking payment functionality. I added a few products to my cart, then checked out and paid using the test card number from stripe. Everything went as expected and the form was submitted. To make sure the payment went through I went to my stripe account's Events and saw that the payment was created.
 
<img src='/media/stripe_1.png' style="padding: 5px;">
 
9. testing loading overlay. It didn't load well the first time, but after hard reloading it started working.
 
10. Verifying that webhooks came from stripe. First, I set up the stripe API key and next the webhook secret, which I needed to verify that the webhook actually came from stripe. To confirm the webhook view is working I printed out "success" in my terminal and then returned a 200 response.
 
<img src='/media/webhooks.png' style="margin: 0;">
 
This means that anytime stripe sends me a webhook it lets me know that an event has occurred.
I have effectively set up a listener to listen to messages from stripe.
 
11. To verify that my webhook works properly. Due to a faulty wh link my first attempts failed, but the second one was a success.
 
<img src='/media/webhooks_attemps.png' style="margin: 0;">
 
12. Payment intent testing. Ok.
 
13. Testing payment system with different test card numbers provided by Stripe.
To test the stripe payment system, I filled out a billing address form and used 4242424242424242 (CVC any 5 digits) test card numbers, typed in a valid expiration date in the future, and a random CVC number. It all went well and a successful payment was created.
 
I repeated the same test with 2 other cards:
 
   5555555555554444    Mastercard  CVC (Any 5 digits).  test: passed
   378282246310005 American Express CVC (Any 5 digits).  test: passed
 
14. Testing checkout form with wrong details. I tested the checkout form by purposely entering wrong information (wrong CVS-too short or too long, ..etc) or didn't provide required information like name or country. As expected each time I would get an error message.
 
15. Testing manually functionality of all the Cupid Store's features by logging into the page, selecting a product, navigating to checkout and paying for it with a test card number. Checking the profile page for the history record.
 
### Testing Tools
The following testing tools were used to minimize site errors:
 
W3C Markup Validator
W3C CSS Validator
pyTest
PEP8
Diffchecker
HTML Formatter
Language Tool
CSS Beautyfier
 
### Notes
 
HTML
I passed my HTML code through the W3C Markup Validation Service. I had some unclosed tags,and other minor errors that thanks to the validation I could easily spot and correct.
 
CSS
I checked all CSS code with the W3C Markup Validation Service. All individual CSS files passed without any errors.
 
JavaScript
I used JSHint to check my JavaScript code.
 
Python
For this project I installed PEP8 on my gitpod, which made it faster to spot any errors. As expected I always had a few indentation errors and warnings that some lines were too long. 
 
### Compatibility tests
Using different browsers
I manually tested the project on the following web browsers, checking that all aspects worked as planned:
 
Google Chrome
Apple Safari
 
### Using different devices
 
The project has been tested on the following devices:
<h2 align="center"><img src='/media/testing_responsivness.png' style="margin: 0;"></h2>
 
I found it quite challenging to make my app equally responsive on all devices. It would probably require a way more time to test every single aspect of the app on many different devices.

# 7. Deployment
 
###  Github Deployment
 
My project was first developed using Gitpod as the chosen IDE and GitHub as a remote repository.
 
The project's GitHub repository link: https://github.com/amorawskanew/cupid_ecommerce_store_project_4
 
The deployed project link: https://cupid-store.herokuapp.com/
 
* I started my project from creating a new repository on github and downloading Code Institute template to my workspace.
* I created my project
* I saved all the dependencies in requirements.txt file using "pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt" command
* I created Procfile file that starts with capital using "echo web: python3 app.py > Procfile" command
* I committed all the changes and pushed to github
 
### Heroku Deployment
 
* Next, I logged in to Heroku from my terminal by using heroku login -i
* I signed in to Heroku and created a new application with a unique name
* I set the region to Europe, which is the closest to me
* To use Postgres I went back to gitpod and installed dj_database_url, and psycopg2.
* I froze the requirements with pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
* In the root folder, I created a file named Procfile with the following content: web:
gunicorn milestone_project_final.wsgi:application
Procfile contains a command that Heroku will run when the app starts.
* I went to settings.py and imported dj_database_url.
 
* 'In Heroku I went to Config Vars and set all the required environmental variables.
 
<h2 align="center"><img src='/media/ReadMe_key.png' style="margin: 0;"></h2>
 
* In the settings.py, I added the URL of my heroku app to the ALLOWED_HOST section (without the https):
 
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["cupid-store.herokuapp.com", 'localhost',]
 
I commit all files to heroku with the following commands:
git add .
git commit -m "deploy to Heroku"
git push heroku master
* I made a superuser with this command python3 manage.py createsuperuser
* I completed the deployment by pushing my project to heroku with:
git push heroku master
Once deployed, I continued to push all the changes made during further project development.
 
### AWS Deployment
* I followed Code Institute tutorial to deploy my media and all my static to AWS
