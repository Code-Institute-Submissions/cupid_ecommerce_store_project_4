Welcome amorawskanew,

<h2>Used Materials</h2>




<h2>Tests</h2>

1. Test whether allauth is working properly, I run the server with a command: 'python3 manage.py runserver'
I opened the project and navidated to accounts/login. I tried to login using superuser and this directed me to the page asking for email confirmation. that this directs us back to a page telling us we need to confirm our email. So allauth is working because email confirmations are required in order to log in.

2. at the beginning of creating home and about pages in store app, I used HttpResponse to send some text to both pages to check if my setup is working.

3. I created a folder templates to contain all my html files, because django will look for temaplates by default

4. Creating home and about pages and testing them in a browser.
